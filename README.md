# sparkify-airflow-etl
Airflow DAG to run ETL process to populate Redshift db with Sparkify data from S3 data sources.

**Background:**
The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the Sparkify music application and JSON metadata 
about the songs the users listen to. Source datasets reside in S3. This repo contains an Airflow DAG consisting of three 
main steps:
* load the JSON files into staging tables in Redshift
* transform data from staging tables into fact and dimension final tables
* run data quality checks on final tables

To do so, we create the following four Airflow operators:
* StageToRedshiftOperator - copies data from S3 data sources to staging tables in Redshift
* LoadFactOperator - populates 'songplays' fact table
* LoadDimensionOperator - populates 'users', 'artists', 'songs', and 'time' dimension tables
* DataQualityOperator - runs a set of user-defined sql statements and checks results against provided expected output

**Final DAG:**

**Steps to use this ETL process to populate a Redshift db:**
1. Create a Redshift cluster and run all create table statements in `create_tables.sql`
2. Connect to Airflow and configure Airflow connections for the following:
      * aws_credentials: AWS IAM user credentials that can access the S3 data sources
      * redshift: the Redshift cluster details so Airflow can access and write to the db
3. Turn on and allow scheduled runs and/or manually run the 'sparkify_etl_dag'
